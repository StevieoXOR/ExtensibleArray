# ExtensibleArray
My two versions (generic and specified-type) of a C# Array that dynamically grows in capacity when needed.
Methods of both ExtensibleArray and GenericExtensibleArray:
__ Print, ToString, PrintAll, Embiggen (Increases capacity without adding an important value), Prepend, Append, Test.
ExtensibleArray's printed arrays are more precisely coded than GenericExtensibleArray's Prints (to improve readability), at the expense of a significantly longer program.
